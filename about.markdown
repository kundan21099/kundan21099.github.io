## Who Am I ?

I’m a **Master’s student in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at Hochschule Darmstadt** with a passion for **embedded systems, sensor integration, and real-time software (RTOS)**.  

I enjoy **designing, developing, and optimizing firmware and IoT solutions** that improve device performance, reliability, and automation. I’m comfortable working with **C/C++, Python, hardware debugging**, and collaborating across teams to deliver **high-impact, practical solutions**.  

When I’m not coding or debugging hardware, I like exploring ideas in **Economics, Psychology, and Physics**—always curious about how the world works!
