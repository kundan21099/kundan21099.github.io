abstract: "Now a days, increasing environmental pollution, world population, water scarcity, etc. are some major issues faced by the society. We need solutions, which would be implemented from a individual person to large industries. Definition of water management is difficult, but as long as the wastage of water is avoided, everyone is contributing to solving water scarcity. The purpose of this research is to monitor the usage of water, avoid overflow, and ultimately find the way to save water. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the level of the tank, the flow sensor is used to measure the flow rate of water and total consumed volume. Level, flow rate, and volume data will be sent by Node MCU to the mobile app using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol. Also, the solenoid valve which works as a tap from the mobile app can be controlled. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is a lightweight, publish/subscribe-based protocol and works on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) layer which is perfect for constrained devices like Node MCU."
